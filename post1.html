        <p>Tired of starting your day with 10 tabs open? We've all been there. Modern platforms are designed to maximize your distraction, not your output. To write fast, you need to be **boring**.</p>

        <p>Our method is simple, and it's built on Web 1.0 principles:</p>
        
        <ol style="color: #00FF00;">
            <li>**Start with a Blank Screen (Not a Feed):** Our writing page has literally nothing but your text. No "what's trending," no likes counter.</li>
            <li>**The 25-Minute Block:** Just like the old GeoCities users, you have a finite time before you have to manually refresh. Use that time to crush your draft.</li>
            <li>**Focus Coach Review:** Once you're done, let the AI review for three things only: **Clarity, Length, and Intent.** No style policing.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This post itself was written using the Focus Coach AI, which told me my introduction was too "modern" and should be more direct. **The results speak for themselves.** Now, go try it!</p>
